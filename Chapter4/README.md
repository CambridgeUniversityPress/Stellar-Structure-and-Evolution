## Data Files

### Figure 4.2 - Oxygen and iron opacity

Data files in the Kappa folder are models calculated by Dr. Franck Delahaye, LERMA - Observatoire de Paris., Site de Meudon for oxygen and iron
opacities in solar metallicity gas.

### Figure 4.3 - Rosseland Mean Opacity

Data files in the Rosseland folder are rosseland mean opacity as a function of temperature for gas of solar abundance (photosphere: X=0.749, Y=0.238, Z=0.013)
calculated for different densities from the [Opacity Project OPserver](opacities.osc.edu/rmos.shtml).
