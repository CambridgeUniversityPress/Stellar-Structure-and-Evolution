Oxygen and Iron Opacity
SSE Figure 4.2

Contributions to opacity as a function of photon energy in gas of solar
abundance with T = 2.1 × 10^6 K and ρ = 0.06 g cm^−3 for oxygen and
iron.

Files with oxygen and iron opacities (kappa) as a function of
photon energy.  For each atom, X, there are three files:
   kappa_X_tot.txt - total opacity
   kappa_X_bf.txt - bound-free opacity
   kappa_X_ff.txt - free-free opacity
For iron only, we have a 4th file:
   kappa_Fe_bb.txt - bound-bound opacity

Finally, kappa_weightFunc.txt is the weight function

All files have 2 columns
  Col 1: photon energy in eV
  Col 2: opacity kappa in a_o^2/atom, where a_o is the Bohr Radius

For the SSE book we convert a_o^2/atom into cgs units of cm^2/g to
confirm to the units used throughout the text.
