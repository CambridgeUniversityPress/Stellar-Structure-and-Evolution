## Data Files

### Figure 5.1 - Nuclear binding energy

AME2020 data files from the [Atomic Mass Data Center website](https://www-nds.iaea.org/amdc/)

### Figure 5.2 - Astrophysical S-factor

Data are from laboratory experiments, models adapted from Xu et al. 2013, Figure 79.

### Figure 5.4 and 5.8 - BP2004 Solar Model

Data file from Bahcall and Pinsonneault 2004, astro-ph/0402114, data file provided in this folder

### Figure 5.6 - Solar neutrino data

The data files are from [John Bahcall's Neutrino Software and Data](http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/SNdata/sndata.html).  The text files used to plot
the energy spectra are as follows:
<dl>
 <dd>pp: http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/SNdata/ppspectrum.html
 <dd><sup>8</sup>B: http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/SNdata/b8spectrum.html
 <dd>CNO: http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/SNdata/cnospectra.html
</dl>
Some reformatting was required to get into a common file format for this plot and these reformatted data are in the directory with the notebooks.
